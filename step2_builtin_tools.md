# Step 2: Builtin tools

An agent on its own can't do much other than just chat with you. To make agents
more useful we need to give the agent tools that it can use to gather
information and execute actions.

`cagent` has builtin tools and also support for MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Builtin tools

`cagent` has 3 builtin generic agentic tools

- `think`
- `todo`
- `memory`

### Think

The `think` tool gives the model the ability to stop and think. It's a kind of a
whiteboard that the model can use to jot down its thoughts.

Read more about the thinking tool
[here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool).

To use this tool, add the `type: think` tool to the toolset of your agent

```yaml
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: You talk like a pirate
    toolsets:
      - type: think
```

You can try by asking your pirate agent `Think before you answer, where is the treasure map?`

TODO: @rumpl add version explanation

### Memory

The memory tool gives the agent the ability to remember things about the user.

Give this agent a try:

```yaml
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: You are a personal asisstant
    toolsets:
      - type: memory
        path: ./memory.db
```

Run this agent once, tell it your name and some random fact about you. Something like `I'm XXX and I'm a software engineer`. You
should see it calling the memory tools to remember facts about you.

If you then quit cagent and start a new session with this agent. You can ask it what
it knows about you, it should correctly look up its internal memory and tell you
what it knows. For example: `Who am I?` or `What do I do for a living?`

### Todo

TODO: @rumpl --> introduce developer progression

The `todo` toolset instructs the model to use its todo-tracking tools when it
needs to do a complex task. This tool can help the model keep in line while it's
working on a complex task.

Adding the `todo` toolset works the same way as the `think`

```yaml
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: You are an amazing developer
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
```

_Note:_ Here we changed the model used from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-4o`, larger
models are usually better at tool calling and following instructions, feel free
to test out as many models as you wish with different setups.

Try this agent, see how it _magically_ creates todo lists for its tasks and
loops until the todos are done.

### Development related builtin tools

`cagent` agents can be given access to your shell or your filesystem to run
commands or read/write files or directories.

- `shell`
- `filesystem`

Let's start creating our own developer agent. We will take the developer above
and give it access to our shell and filesystem.

```yaml
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: You are an amazing developer
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
      - type: shell
      - type: filesystem
```

This is basically all it takes to have a basic developer agent. Try it out! Ask
it to "write a snake game in an index.html file"

## Extra

This developer agent is a good start, there is one piece missing though that
would make it even better, it doesn't really know anything about the environment
it is working in, l, it _could_ find it out by running shell scripts, but that's
just wasting tokens. `cagent` can automatically add information about the
environemt the agent is working on by adding `add_environemt_info: true` to the
agent definition:

```diff
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: You are an amazing developer
+    add_environment_info: true
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
      - type: shell
      - type: filesystem
```

Run this agent again, ask it what the current directory is or if the current
directory is a git repository. The agent now knows this without having to make
any tool calls. Neat!

The information that is added to its system prompt with this is:

- the current directory
- the current platform (windows, linux, etc.
- information if the current directory is a git repository or not

If you think that your agent needs to know what the current date you can add
this to its system prompt too:

```diff
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: You are an amazing developer
    add_environment_info: true
+    add_date: true
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
      - type: shell
      - type: filesystem
```

This can be useful if you are plannig on asking your agent qauestions like "What
were the commits made in this repository in the last day?"

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific in Instructions**: Tell agents how to use their tools
   effectively
2. **Combine Complementary Tools**: Think + filesystem, shell + todo, etc.
3. **Consider Security**: Be careful with shell access and file permissions
4. **Start Simple**: Begin with one tool, then add more as needed

## Next Steps

In the next step we will take a look at ways we can make our developer agent
even more powerful thanks to MCP servers.
