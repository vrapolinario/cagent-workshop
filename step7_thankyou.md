# Step 7: Thank You

Congratulations! You've completed the cagent workshop and learned how to build
intelligent agents that can work together on complex tasks.

## What You've Learned

Throughout this workshop you've covered:

- Basic agent configuration and builtin tools (`think`, `memory`, `todo`,
  `shell`, `filesystem`)
- MCP integration for extending agent capabilities with external services
- Multi-agent systems with specialized roles and task delegation
- Agent sharing through Docker registries
- Working with different AI providers and local models through DMR

## Next Steps

You now have the foundation to build production-ready agent solutions. Whether
you're automating development workflows, creating content pipelines, or solving
domain-specific problems, you have the tools to implement it.

The agents you built in this workshop are starting points. Modify them, combine
them, and adapt them to your specific needs.

Thank you for working through this workshop. Next steps? Have fun with it!
